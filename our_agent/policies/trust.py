# Voting policy: Follow other people's role claims
# Everyone starts out at 0.5
# If a role claims to have confirmed them evil, they go up to 1
# If a role claims to have confirmed them town, they go down to 0
# Maybe we could try also a version of this that scales with our own trust of that person (either based on neural net or based on recorded stats about them lying about having that particular role) idk, sample py didn't seem to need it
